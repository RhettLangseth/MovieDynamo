# MovieDyanmo

### Purpose

The goal of the MovieDynamo program is to essentially provide an API that receives information from the user and returns a list of suggested films. The way this typically works is that the user inputs a list of movies that they like. 

### Usage

```python
# create a list of suggested films
python MovieDynamo.py suggestFilms inputFile.json

# print the list of suggested films
python MovieDynamo.py printSuggestions inputFile.json
```
